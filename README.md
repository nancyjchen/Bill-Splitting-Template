# Bill-Splitting-Template
Purpose: To create a spreadsheet that calculates the bill for each person

Suppose you and your group of friends went to Costco and the items you all decide to buy are split between different people. Since one person needs to pay at the end and calculating how much each person owe is a pain, this spreadsheet helps you calculate that amount. Of course, it's not limited to just Costco trips - it's for any trips that involves bill splitting. 

All you need to do is input the following: 
* Items you guys bought
* The number of each item
* Check off who bought what item
* Enter the total cost and the total amount paid

To get started: 
1. Run the python code: python3 main.py
2. Open the spreadsheet output.xlxs
3. Change columns D to [next empty column] into checkboxes.
4. Now you're reading to fill out the info needed to calculate each person's bill!
